## Getting started.

This API is tested with

* Python 2 
* Python 3

There are two ways to install the framework:

* Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

```bash
$ pip install tambotapi
```
* Installation from source (requires git):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ma24th/tambotapi.git
$ cd tambotapi
$ python setup.py install
```

It is generally recommended to use the first option.

**While the API is production-ready, it is still under development and it has regular updates, do not forget to update it regularly by calling `pip install tambotapi --upgrade`*
