Getting started
---------------

This API is tested with

* Python 2
* Python 3

There are two ways to install the framework:

* Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

    ``$ pip install tambotapi``

* Installation from source (requires git):

    ``$ git clone https://github.com/ma24th/tambotapi.git``

    ``$ cd tambotapi``

    ``$ python setup.py install``

It is generally recommended to use the first option.

While the API is production-ready, it is still under development and it has regular updates, do not forget to update it regularly by calling ``pip install tambotapi --upgrade``
